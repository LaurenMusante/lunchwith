#### _Match mentors and mentees up over lunch to discuss skills and career options. January - February 2020_

#### By _**Mike McShane & Lauren Musante**_

## Description

_This is a desktop application that allows users to sign up for an account and create a profile that includes 3 technical skills that they are interested in either learning or teaching. User selects whether they are signing up to be a mentor or a mentee. Mentor adds their weekly availability. The application uses geolocation to plot mentor location on a Google map. Mentees can search for mentors based on their skills and locations. Once a mentor is selected based on availability and location, the mentee will send an invite to them along with 3 restaurant choices for where to meet up. This will add a lunch to their calendar as "pending." The mentor receives the invite with the list of restaurant choices and then either selects a restaurant and accepts the invitation, or declines the invitation all together, with an option to include a note. If the mentor accepts the invitation, it will be add a lunch as "confirmed" to both the mentor and mentee's profile._
